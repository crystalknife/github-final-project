# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our project and community a respectful, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment, especially since our project is dedicated to empowering low-income individuals through accessible financial tools.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Providing constructive feedback gracefully
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy and kindness toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information (like a physical or email address) without permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities
